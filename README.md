Included:
-------------------
this README, 
project7part1.py file, 
project7part2.py file,
output from executing python files

-------------------
Packages 
------------------
Install packages for 
- numpy 
Using pip (sudo apt install python-pip) 
Install numpy (pip install numpy or pip3 install numpy (depending on version of Python))
Verify numpy installation (pip show numpy / pip3 show numpy)
(program code includes importing the package -- import numpy as np)
- scipy
Using pip install scipy (pip install scipy)
- matplotlib
Using pip (pip install matplotlib)
(program code includes importing the package -- import matplotlib.pyplot as plt)
- odeint
(program code imports the package using scipy from scipy.integrate import odeint)
Import module math to be able to run calculations
- import math 

------------------
Design Decisions & Project Issues
------------------
From the flowchart shown in the documentation, the code was modeled based on this layout,
and the methodology shown in the handwritten work.
The equations and steps for understanding the algorithm used can be seen further explained in
the documentation.
Initial values were also provided and can be seen implemented throughout the code and described in the documentation.


Various project issues that were encountered involved understanding the algorithms used,
and being able to successfully implement that. 

-------------------
Results 
-------------------
Running the code will result in:
- graphs modeling the solution for part 1
- graphs modeling the solution for part 2
